# STAAR_Scores

Skill assessment part of my application to Teaching Trust's Jr. Data Scientist position.

The goal was to wrangle and present STAAR testing scores to show the percentage of students whose reading scores met the 
approaching grade level and the meets grade level overall,by school type, by gender, and by race.

I hadn't worked much with wide-format data in R before so there was a lot of learning involved.
